Hi, I am Mingdao Gong, a master's student at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), majoring in Artificial Intelligence.

My research interests lie in deep learning, medical image analysis, and image registration. Currently, I am focusing on designing and evaluating algorithms for robust and accurate medical image registration, particularly integrating anatomical priors such as vascular structures to improve performance.
